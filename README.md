# Google-kickstart-practice
A repository that records my understanding and code of some google kickstart questions
To be better in coding and logic, I decide to do kickstart every week, and offer my code and thoughts here. 
For every .py file, it is a question from google kickstart or codejam, the discription of question will be included in the file.
You are welcomed to improve my code.
Thank you
